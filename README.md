# ipython-vega

iPython/Jupyter notebook module for [Vega](/vega/vega-lite), and [Vega-Lite](/vega/vega-lite), [polestar](/vega/polestar), and [voyager](/vega/voyager).

## Status

This project is in a very early stage but we have a [working prototype](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/vega/ipython-vega/blob/master/Example.ipynb).

### TODO

* Add Vega integration [#18](/vega/ipython-vega/issues/18)
* Add Vega-Lite integration [#10](/vega/ipython-vega/issues/10)
* Add export functionality to polestar so that a visualization can be saved in a new cell [#3](/vega/ipython-vega/issues/3)
* Save state of voyager and polestar [#19](/vega/ipython-vega/issues/19)

## Get started with development

* install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* run kernel: `ipython notebook`
